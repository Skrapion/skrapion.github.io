Day 2! Today we made it from Blind River to Wawa!

We made it to the Sault this morning before exploring Agawa Bay, where we made a few stops just to admire the beautiful Lake Superior shoreline.

We stopped by the Agawa Bay pictographs: Ojibway rock paintings dating 150-400 years old depicting a war with the Iroquois. I included the most famous one: a war boat following Mishibijiw, the Great Lynx god.

Beautiful views from the Orphan Lake trail, and finally, more giant things! This time a giant goose celebrating the completion of the Trans Canada Highway.

Now it's time to find a place to spend the night. We might "camp" in the truck instead of our tent in order to stay out of the forecast thunderstorms ‚õàÔ∏èüí§

Good night, friends!
