This is the Scratches, Splinters, and Scrapes Station I made for our makerspace so we can easily access tweezers, antiseptic pads, and bandaids without having to dig into the first aid kits.

Fits:
* 1x3" bandaids
* ⅜×1½" junior bandaids
* Banzalkorium chloride antiseptic pads
* Uncle Bills Super Gripper tweezers

This was modelled in Fusion 360 as a parametric model, so it can be easily modified if your first aid supplies are a different size. All files, including the label, [can be found on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4125659).
