A steady rest for the wood lathe at Yukonstruct. I designed this specifically for this segmented vase, and cut it out on our CNC router.

This was designed as a parametric model in Fusion 360 and cut out of some scrap plywood. All the files, and the required hardware, [can be found on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4109405).
