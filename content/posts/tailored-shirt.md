A more challenging tailoring job this time. Brought in the sides (with flat-felled seams), the darts, and the arms (the armpits were particularly challenging).

In the process of experimenting with how to do this, I had to rip a lot of stitches, I ruined a Value Village shirt I was practicing on, and I never figured out a good way to sew flat-felled seams on sleeves, but it certainly looks a lot better now.
