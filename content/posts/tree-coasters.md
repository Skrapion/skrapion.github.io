Here's the gift I made for our Yukonstruct Secret Santa this year. It's a set of coasters made out of birch pallet wood.

I used a CNC to carve out different species of trees, and then filled the carvings with resin and copper mica powder.

The source images all came from one of my favorite reference books: [With the Grain, by Christian Becksvoort](https://lostartpress.com/products/with-the-grain-a-craftsman-s-guide-to-understanding-wood). For those wondering, the trees are birch, pine, poplar, and maple.
