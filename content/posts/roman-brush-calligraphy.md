Completed a new font based on an ancient manuscript of Virgil’s Aeneid. It’s a couple hundred years older than the era I’m going for, but it’s the oldest sample of Roman brush calligraphy I could find.

Lanuvium looks especially weird, but I found other examples of UV being rendered as VV. Also, the R and S break modern typographical rules.
