Day 13! This morning we doubled back a little bit to hike up the Bow Summit Trail, which is the highest point on the Icefields Parkway. Along this hike we found a glorious view of Peyto Lake. We had already seen this wonderfully aquamarine lake last year, but seeing it from this vantage point was like seeing it with new eyes. The colour is astonishing, and we stopped in awe every ten feet up the trail, with each view looking more stunning than the last. If anybody goes to see this site, don't stop at the official vantage point: there's an amazing view further up with far fewer tourists if you go just a little bit off the marked trails.

Back in the truck again, we decided to stop at the Athabasca Glacier, which we visited during [last year's trip to Banff](/banff-landscapes). Caitlyn got a pretty good photo of the immensity of it, and this time I walked right up the the glacier and was quite impressed the the amount of melt water coming off of it, but decided not to go much further, what with all the large warnings of hidden crevasses.

North of here was entirely new territory for us, so we stopped at almost every viewpoint along the way, and were particularly excited about the Tangle Falls. Not only did they offer a jaw dropping view from the road, but they also provided a very fun scramble most of the way up the cliffside, and the two of us were giggling by the time we made it to the top.

Finally, we decided to camp overnight at Honeymoon Lake, and as we were driving there, the sunset behind the mountains continued to get more and more beautiful, until I insisted that we stop the truck and climb up the rockface along the side of the road to capture the moment. It turns out it was a little risky, because by the time we got to the campsite, we got the very last spot, right next to the noisiest neighbours, but it was worth it!

Good night friends! We'll be in touch ;)
