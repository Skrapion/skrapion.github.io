Day 10! We finally crossed the Crowsnest pass and made it into BC. From here on out it's mountains all the way to our new home! And our trip started with another giant thing: the world's biggest dump truck! The Titan 33-19 is the only truck of this size made in the world, and operated from 1978 to 1990 in Sparwood when it was decommissioned because this one-of-a-kind vehicle required expensive one-of-a-kind parts. And we knew we were really in BC when there was a nearby sushi truck with delicious tuna tataki rolls!

After that we had a few very pleasant dead-ends. We got a little lost on our way to the Cottonwoods near Morrissey Provincial Park, enjoying the trek through the logging roads and the stony shores until we eventually found those ancient black cottonwoods, 250-400 years old. (Most only live to 150 years!)

We also explored the beautiful towns of Cranbrook and Kimberley. We were hoping to see the Ktunaxa Interpretive Centre — which had very inspiring programming, but had already closed — and the Teck Sunmine — Canada's largest tracking solar panel installation — but despite our best attempts, we couldn't find any public vantages of it :(

Finally, after traversing the cliffside gravel roads of the Rockies, we made it to Whiteswan Lake Provincial Park, where they have the most wonderful hot springs either of us have ever seen. Unlike most hot springs, which have been developed into conventional swimming pools, the Lussier Hot Springs are mostly natural, with some strategically placed rocks forming pools of varying temperatures as the hot spring mixes with the cold river flowing past.

That's all for now. Have a wonderful day, friends!
