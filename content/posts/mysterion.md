I'm an angel keeping watch over the city at night. As violence and darkness take over the streets I work to rid this city of crime. I'm the symbol this town needs.

Definitely some flashbacks to my [Riddler costume](/riddler/) here. Another question mark made out of foam, and I re-used the leather mask under Mysterion's hood to give it structure.

By far the most complicated part of the costume was the sewing. I made a pattern out of my running clothes and resewed it in lavender spandex.
