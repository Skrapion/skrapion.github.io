Day 3 on our move to Whitehorse!

Today we made it from Wawa to Thunder Bay, starting with a rainy view of the Silver Falls in Michipicoten, and then heading to Pebble Beach in Marathon as the fog lifted.

The Aguasabon Gorge was definitely worth the view, and Caitlyn and I stayed there for quite a while just enjoying the spray of the rather intense waterfall below.

Finally, we made it to Thunder Bay. Today's Giant Thingâ„¢ is the Sleeping Giant, a park across from Thunder Bay that appears to be a giant lying on his back in the lake. We also found a very cute fox in Hillcrest Park which I followed until I could get a nice shot of him :)

Tonight, we're sleeping in a very comfy bed care of Chris James and his remarkably hospitable parents! We were greeted with incredible warmth and an unexpected (and delicious!) meal! Thank you to our incredibly gracious hosts! It feels good to get a nice shower and a warm bed!

Good night, friends!
