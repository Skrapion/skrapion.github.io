We're currently camping at Riding Mountain National Park, surrounded by fireflies, beautiful vistas, and the sound of the crackling campfire and waves gently lapping at the shore.

Today's theme was wildlife! After a very restful and luxurious sleep-in, we headed along one of Manitoba's gravel roads toward Riding Mountain, stopping on the way to enjoy the sandy beaches of Manitoba Lake, where we delighted by pelicans, terns, and yellow-headed blackbirds!

Inside the park we found a mama bison and her calf, and a I climbed on top of the truck to get the shot you see here. A little further down the road we saw a mama black bear and her two cubs, climbing the trees for safety. Clearly they could tell Caitlyn was tempted to snuggle them!

We've had a very restful night at our campsite, enjoying the sunset over the water, dinner over the campfire, the calls of the loons, and the gentle breeze.

It's twenty to midnight, and there's still light on the horizon. And we're headed north.
