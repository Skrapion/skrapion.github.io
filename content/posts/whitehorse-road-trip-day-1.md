Not a lot of stops; we were trying to get as many miles behind us as possible in Ontario, but neither of us had driven much further beyond Sudbury before, so from here on out everything is brand new territory!

We stopped by the giant nickel, of course. That will be the first of many giant monuments. We're currently staying overnight in Blind River, where we took in the beautiful sunset, and caught a glimpse of a moose in the wild! (Also a fox, but it ran away before we could snap a photo!)

Good night friends! We'll keep you updated as we go â™¥
