A couple friends threw a wonderful 1940’s-themed party tonight, so I painted my arms with jagua tattoos and went as a WWII sailor. Here’s the best tattoo (after practicing with different tattoos on the rest of my body).

It’ll be about 10 days before these fade away, but I still have some jagua left over, and it only lasts in the fridge for 2 months, so if any of my artist friends want to use me as a temporary canvas, go ahead and send me your design.
