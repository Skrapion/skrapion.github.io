I tried to design a low-resolution T-shirt design for my Minecraft character. I didn't actually have enough resolution to make this design work in Minecraft, but luckily, real t-shirts have plenty of resolution!

And I still ended up making a Minecraft skin that resembles this T-shirt :)

This design can be purchased on an actual T-shirt from [Design by HÃ¼mans](https://www.designbyhumans.com/shop/t-shirt/men/8-bit-valentine/242422/) or [Threadless](https://www.threadless.com/shop/@skrapion/design/8-bit-valentine).
