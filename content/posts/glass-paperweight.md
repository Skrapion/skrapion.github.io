The first time I visited Whitehorse with Caitlyn, we had a "hot date" as Lumel Studios, and we each made a paperweight and a flower.

After a somewhat muddled-looking flower, I learned the importance of restraint. This was just two colors twisted together, and the clear coating was dipped in water to give it that cracked texture.
