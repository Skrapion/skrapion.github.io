In time for Yukomicon this year I put together a costume for Flycatcher from Fables.

I ended up using a surprising number of tools from Yukonstruct for this costume. The eyes were 3D printed globes, with vinyl-cut irises, the spots on Flycatchers cap were laser cut out of felt, and the jumpsuit was way baggier than in the comics, so I tailored it to fit like a glove.
