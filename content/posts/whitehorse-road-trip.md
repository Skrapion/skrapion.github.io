In October 2016, Caitlyn and I visited Whitehorse, and we fell in love with it. We started fantasizing about moving to Whitehorse, and then spent the next year convincing ourselves that it didn't just have to be a fantasy. In June of 2018, we finally made the plunge.

We spent 19 days driving from Toronto to Whitehorse in what ended up being a sort of pilgrimage as we explored our vast country on the way to our new home.

This is our travelogue. Each of the images here links to one day of our journey.

Happy Canada Day everyone! This was an incredible way to celebrate it.
