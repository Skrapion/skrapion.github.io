Hello again friends! It's day 11 and we've made it to Banff!

After our morning dip at Alces Lake, we set on the road again, making our way through the Kootenays, which was full of spectacular vistas. The whole day left is with the feeling that we couldn't possibly capture the beauty of the park with our cameras.

One of our first stops was Numa Falls. The bridge had been washed out, but the view from the cliffside was spectacular, and it was easy to imagine how such a forceful current could destroy the bridge.

Next up was the paint pots, an expanse of ochre-rich mud which was used by the First Nations to make red and yellow paint. After the strikingly red water of the paint pots, we went to the strikingly blue water of the Marble Canyon Falls, which was a never-ending parade of deeper and more impressive crevasses, filled with the loveliest sound of rushing water echoing up the canyon walls. The series of interpretive signs describing the water's influence on the geological history of the canyon was particularly well presented.

Now that we're in Banff, we're just settling down for the night. We're expecting another stormy night to serenade us with the beautiful sounds of raindrops ðŸ’§ðŸ˜Š

Goodnight, friends!
