Along this stretch of road, sightings of moose, bear, mountain goats, and even entire herds of threatened wood bison become common. At one point, I was sitting on top of the truck as we simply waited for the bison to graze on past us. Despite the daunting size of this vast field of powerful, woolly giants, it was such a peaceful experience to have them so close to us, listening to them gently tear at the wild flowers as they slowly moved on to the next grazing spot."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Our next stop was the Liard River Hot Springs, a beautiful provincial park full of hundreds of species of flora that couldn't grow this far north without the warm waters flowing through the earth here. Unlike many other hot springs, which are frequently developed into stereotypical swimming pools, here they merely built a boardwalk on one side, put down some pleasant pebbles on the river bottom, and left most of the rest of the spring in its natural state, with overhangs of greenery draped along the edge of the turquoise waters, hot waters bubbling at one end, and a secret canal leading to a cold spring at the other."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"After a couple relaxing hours, we sat our pruny bodies back down in the truck and headed for our final target: the Yukon!"}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"The Alaska Highway dips back down into BC in a couple spots, so the first time you cross the border, there isn't an official welcome sign.
