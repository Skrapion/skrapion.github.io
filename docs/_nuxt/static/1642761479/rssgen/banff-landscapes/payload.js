The roaring waterfall here has carved cavernous trenches into the rock. The sound is deafening, and the canyon has been left mostly natural, without being marred with safety rails. It's a bit of a pet peeve of mine, but when you take these beautiful places and barricade them behind safety rails, the whole thing feels more distant to me, as though I'm seeing it on a screen. When I can actually wander through the landscape, it feels much more personal."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"The next big stop was Lake Loise, with its beautiful blue waters.
