This morning we doubled back a little bit to hike up the Bow Summit Trail, which is the highest point on the Icefields Parkway. Along this hike we found a glorious view of Peyto Lake. We had already seen this wonderfully aquamarine lake last year, but seeing it from this vantage point was like seeing it with new eyes. The colour is astonishing, and we stopped in awe every ten feet up the trail, with each view looking more stunning than the last. If anybody goes to see this site, don't stop at the official vantage point: there's an amazing view further up with far fewer tourists if you go just a little bit off the marked trails."}]},{type:a,value:f},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Back in the truck again, we decided to stop at the Athabasca Glacier, which we visited during "},{type:b,tag:"nuxt-link",props:{to:"\u002Fbanff-landscapes"},children:[{type:a,value:"last year's trip to Banff"}]},{type:a,value:".
