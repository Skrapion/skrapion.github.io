The sand was as fine as flour and felt delightful under our bare feet. We puzzled over deciphering the footprints in the sand (two different insects left zipper-like tracks; a badger left hairy swishes in the sand) and delighted in watching the ground squirrels and the birds (various songbirds and the quick-moving shrike). Then we put on shoes again to trek across the scrublands to explore the other dunes, discovering sage, juniper, little cacti, and wild roses along the way. I was particularly happy to find a cooperative hawk on the drive out of the park."}]},{type:a,value:d},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Next we crossed into Alberta and visited Dinosaur Provincial Park, an area that has yielded five percent of the world's known dinosaur fossils.
