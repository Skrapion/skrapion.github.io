Sharing this challenging and rewarding endeavor was a great bonding experience for us - an acute high point in this adventure we've undertaken together on this cross country tour and through life.</p>\n<p>Riding high on this feeling, we said goodbye to Jasper National Park and hit the road again. We're on route to our next camp site, just south of Grande Prairie, and so far have seen a bull elk, three deer, two moose (a mama and baby pair), and a beautiful sunset, which seems to last forever this far north.</p>\n<p>Sleep tight friends!

Now that we’ve had our first out-of-town visitor, we decided to show him all the wonderful animals the preserve is protecting, and not only did we get to take our time, but we took a guided tour which was really interesting! Did you know that ground squirrels freeze every winter, dropping to -6°C, and every spring they regrow the brain cells they lost? Or that Yukon has twice as many moose as people? Or that the wood bison (the heaviest animal on the continent at 2000lbs!) were thought to be extinct until they found a herd of 200 in Alberta in the 1950s?</p>\n<p>We also met a red fox (apparently all foxes with white tips are red foxes) who was “rescued” as a “puppy”, and her rescuers found a dog to nurse it, until they realized it wasn’t a puppy at all! After they realized it was a fox, they called the preserve to take over raising her.
