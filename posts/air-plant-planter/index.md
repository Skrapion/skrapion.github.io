Here's the Secret Santa gift I made this year. It's an air plant planter made of sapele, maple, and copper leaf. Sapele is an African wood related to mahogany and exhibits chatoyancy, which means the stripes in the grain shift colour as the light hits it at different angles.

As always, made with meat-powered tools and traditional methods, including mixing my own animal hide glue and shellac from flakes.

I also crushed some of the geode I found a while back to use as aggregate under the air plants.

I particularly enjoyed making a very modern looking planter with very traditional methods!
