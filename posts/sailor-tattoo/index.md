A couple friends threw a wonderful 1940’s-themed party tonight, so I painted my arms with jagua tattoos and went as a WWII sailor. Most of the tattoos were classic Sailor Jerry designs. Here’s the best tattoo (after practicing with different tattoos on the rest of my body).

It’ll be about 10 days before these fade away, but I still have some jagua left over, and it only lasts in the fridge for 2 months, so if any of my artist friends want to use me as a temporary canvas, go ahead and send me your design.
