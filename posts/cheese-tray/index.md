I get to share this now. Here’s the cheese tray I made for a friend for Secret Santa. It’s made of riven maple and walnut with a pyrographic monogram for her and her fiancé over an acanthus leaf design.

It’s made almost entirely with traditional, meat-powered tools, although I will shamefully admit that the soldering iron I used for the wood burning is electric. I’m pretty happy with it.

Originally I planned on making a drawbored cutting board, but when I started splitting the wood, I ended up with slats that suggested a form that was thinner and rounder.
