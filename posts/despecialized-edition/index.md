This was a gift for a friend who is a big Star Wars fan. It's is a boxset for Harmy's Star Wars Despecialized Edition â€” a fan-made remastering of the original trilogy, but without any of the special edition additions.

I can't take too much credit for this, as it's mostly just taking other people's work and putting it together, but I did have fun with the actual box, which I made by repurposing the backing of sketchbooks and lining it with construction paper, and pulling together some graphics to print on sticker paper.
