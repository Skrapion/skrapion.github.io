One of my favourite memories of Christmas was making ornaments for the tree, like lollipops and stringers of beads, popcorn, and paper. So this year, Caitlyn and I decided to do as much as we could from scratch: we cut down our own tree, and we got crafty.

Lots of paper, twine, beads, and we recycled a book I bought for a dollar that was falling apart.
