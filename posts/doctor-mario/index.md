It's a me! Doctor Mario!

This is my first time making a latex prosthetic, and I'm pretty happy with it! Made the master mould out of Monster Clay and brushed many layers of liquid latex on it. Wish it came out a little smoother, but I think I would have needed to do a slush cast instead of a brush cast for that. Lots to learn still!
