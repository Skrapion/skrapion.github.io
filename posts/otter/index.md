Made this little guy for Caitlyn with the MakerBot2 at the Toronto Reference Library. He's only 5cm tall and only cost $4 to print, so the paint cost more than the actual model.

I started with a stock model of an otter and rigged it in Blender so it could be posed. After that, it was just a matter of modelling the sign and slicing it for the printer.

He's painted with acrylics and a toothpick for the fur texture. The lettering on the sign was originally included in the 3D model, but it wasn't very legible, so I sanded off the lettering and printed the lettering on paper so I could glue it in place.

The base was a whole separate project. His feet were too fragile and fell off when I was cutting off the supports, so I wanted something to keep him sturdy. I glued together four plastic cards and Dremelled them down to shape before throwing on a coat of spray paint before gluing him down. Kind of wish I spent more time sanding it down; would have looked really cool with a mirror finish.
