My first attempt at wire-wrapped jewelry!

This was another secret-Santa project. It's made of copper wire and then tarnished with liver of sulfur and then buffed with steel wool, and I think the World Tree motif was perfect.

It turns out wire wrapped jewelry is a great craft to do while binging Lord of the Rings.
