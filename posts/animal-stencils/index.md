I made these to brighten up my hallway. The frames are made of Baltic birch and sapele with my new favourite finish: raw tung oil and orange extract. The artwork was spray painted with laser-cut stencils, and the playful splashes were added with drops of acrylic paint.

I could see myself doing more of these for the other Yukon animals, but it's hard to imagine a frolicking muskox.
