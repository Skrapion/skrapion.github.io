Here's my late Christmas present to Caitlyn. I had to precisely cut and glue together 240 tiny pieces of maple and walnut. Along the way, I made a 3D model of the vase in order to calculate the correct cut lengths, I made a custom sled for the table saw in order to cut the angles perfectly, and I designed [a large steady rest](/steady-rest/) on the CNC in order to turn such a large piece on the lathe. It's fair to say I learned a tonne!
