                            You've found Firefang, the project blog of Rick 
                            Yorgason. Welcome!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I'm a maker, programmer, woodworker, baker, 
                            photographer, 3D modeller, cosplayer, and general 
                            jack of all trades.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I currently run 
                            <a href="https://yukonstruct.com">Yukonstruct's 
                            Makespace</a>, the first makerspace north of 60Â°, 
                            and before that I was a programmer, designer, and
                            the VP of a little indie game dev studio called
                            <a href="https://longbowgames.com">Longbow Games</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I mostly created this site to make it easier to have
                            conversations about my various projects, but you're
                            welcome to poke around as much as you like!
                        </p>
                        <p>Enjoy!</p>
