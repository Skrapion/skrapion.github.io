Hegemony was my first commercially released game. It's a historical strategy wargame that follows Philip of Macedon's unification of Ancient Greece, as well as the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta.

I was a programmer and designer on this project. We were a small team of only 5 at the time, so it was a very dynamic team with everybody doing a little bit of everything.

The game was coded from scratch in C++ and DirectX, and my most notable programming contributions were the questing system, the camera and controls, and the GUI code.

As a designer, my most notable contribution was probably the Peloponnesian War scenarios. I was responsible for all the research, writing, and quests in those scenarios. I also did all the writing, editing, and even voice overs for all of the cutscenes. One of my favourite sources for research was *the Peloponnesian War* by Donald Kagan, which I still keep on my bookshelf as a memento.
