Another handmade holiday gift! I made this rack for somebody who does quite a lot of quilting and needed a better way to store her rulers.

It's made out of maple and walnut, and has quite a bit of heft! Made entirely with traditional hand tools and then finished with a pyrographic Celtic knot and some Danish oil.

It was a joy to make, and I hope it sees a lot of use as its new owner makes her wonderfully creative and detailed quilts!

Merry Christmas, everyone!
